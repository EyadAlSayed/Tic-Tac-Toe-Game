### X | O Game in two player mode and one player mode against AI player

## Introduction

Tic-tac-toe is a fun game that you can play any time and anywhere as long as you have a piece of paper, a pencil and now on your phone as an app

## How to play 
To beat the computer (or at least tie), you need to make use of a little bit of strategy. Strategy means figuring out what you need to do to win.

If you are the **X** player so you have to figure out how to get three **Xs**  in a row. The other part is trying to figure out how to stop the computer from getting three **Os**  in a row.

After you put an **X**  in a square, you start looking ahead. Where's the best place for your next **X** ?
 You look at the empty squares and decide which ones are good choices—which ones might let you make three **Xs**  in a row.

You also have to watch where the computer puts its O. That could change what you do next. If the computer gets two **Os**  in a row, you have to put your next **X**  in the last empty square in that row, or the computer will win. You are forced to play in a particular square or lose the game.

If you always pay attention and look ahead, you will never lose a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. You may not win, but at least you will tie.

## Two Player Mode 

Instead of computer there will be a human play and he have to play as same as computer strategy
